# Configs Folder

This is a custom folder (not generated by nuxt).  
This folder contains several configuration files needed by the app.

Feel free to add more configs as you may feel necessary.

### `configs/layout`

This folder contains configuration files related to the app layout.  
It includes configuration for Admin Layout's footer, sidebar and navbar elements.

These configs will be also available from the corresponding store module (Eg. [sidebar](/store/sidebar/index.js) and [navbar](/store/navbar/index.js) store).  
Configs can also be imported manually, since their values are not supposed to be reactive.

### `configs/nuxt`

This folder contains all nuxt configuration needed for building the project.  
These configs will be improted by the [`nuxt.config.js`](/nuxt/config.js) file.
