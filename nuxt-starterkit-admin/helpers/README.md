# Helpers Folder

This is another custom folder (not generated by nuxt) which contains helper functions used in the project.  
All shared/general helper functions should be stored here.

Usually helper utilities like [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) would suffice our common needs.  
Lodash is installed in this app and can be imported when needed.

However in some cases you might need to create your own utility and helper functions.  
In that case, please feel free to add more helper functions and store it here.
