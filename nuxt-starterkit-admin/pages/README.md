# Pages Folder

This is the default pages folder created by Nuxt.  
Nuxt is using File system routing, which means all the routes are generated by how the files are organized in this folder.

Please head over to the official Nuxt [Pages documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/pages) to learn more about how to compose your pages.
