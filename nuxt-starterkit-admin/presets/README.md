# Presets Folder

This is a custom folder to store all Presets used in the app.  
Presets can be anything, such as validation rules, notification configs, etc.

Presets serve similar purpose as configs.  
The main difference is presets will be used mostly by component and page codes.
Configs are used mainly for the app layout and build process.

These presets store validation related values. Such ass validation rules, regex, etc.

### `presets/notification`
